HTML
	Hyper Text Mark-up Language => helps you create a static web page

CSS
	Cascading Style Sheet => apply styles to the static web page

JavaScript
	codes (lines of instruction to do something) are written to provide dynamism (i.e. to convert the static web pages into dynamic web pages)


create static web page:
	HTML => provides many pre-defined/built-in "tags" or "elements" to create the design of the web page
such as - H1,..., H6 => heading tag
	  a => anchor tag

	tags can be nested in each other. the wrapper tag is known as parent tag/element (H1) and the tag(s) nested inside is/are known as child tag/children tags
	even texts can be nested inside a tag, known as Text Node

	i.e. HTML tags can contain other tag(s) as well textual node (text) inside them
	<H1>
		<i>
			THE TIMES OF INDIA 
		</i>
	</H1>

	<tag-name> => openning tag
	</tag-name> => closing tag

	If a tag does not have a closing tag, that element is known as Empty tag
	<br> => line break, <meta> => to provide metadata (information) abou the web page

	Tags again, can have attribute(s) (one or more than one)
	attribute: name-value pair
	they are used to provide extra information (metadata) about the elements/tags

	title => displays the title of the page in the title bar of the window

	stucture of an HTML file:
	a. should start with DOCTYPE tag
	b. the document begins with <HTML> tag and ends with </HTML> tag
	c. every HTML file will have two more children tags of <HTML> tag => <head> (optional) and <body>
	d. head => contains information about the HTML file (no design will be present here)
		i. which encoding format will be used to encode the HTML content before sending the same to the client from the server machine
		ii. who has created this document
		iii. how this web page content is going to be rendered in the device according to the view area
		iv. the duration after which the page will automatically refresh or reload
		etc.
		these information are placed inside "head" tag using "meta" tags
		Note: <meta charset="utf-8"> should be the first meta tag inside the head tag

		
	e. body => this element contains the HTML page design


	RWA: Responsive Web Application => the application's content (the web pages) are adjusted according to the view area for better readability

	default web server s/w present in the Windows O/S: IIS (Inter Information Service)
	Application Development Server (App Server): an web server s/w used to host an web application during development time using a random port number. the web application hosted by a app development server can be requested only from the development machine.
	in VS code: Live Server, lite-server etc.



XML:
	Extensible Markup Language
		- to describe data

	a. <?xml version="1.1"?> => XML declaration
	b. followed by the XML declaration line, an root element must be present
	Note: ONLY one root element can be present in the XML file (XML file should logically present/describe one type of data structure) 
	Root element can be called as top-level or document element
	c. every element must have a start and end tags or must be a self-closing tag (empty)
	d. every element can either contain another element or text
	e. must have whitespaces (spaces, tabs, new lines and/or combination of those) which are also considered part of the element
	f. elements can have attributes (which should be mentioned in the start, NOT in the end tag)
	g. attribute names are case-sensitive. 
	h. attribute  values must be placed inside either matching single or double quote

element-naming rules:
	1. can contain letters [A-Z and a-z]
	2. can contain numbers [0-9]
	3. can contain _ (underscore), - (dash) , . (period)
	4. element name can start with either a letter or an underscore, BUT NOT with a number or punctuation character or the letters xml/XML/Xml 
	5. element name can not contain any whitespace
	<first-name> 

XML character entity: &gt; &lt; &amp; &apos; &quot;

	XML documents:
		a. Well formed XML document: when an XML document follows proper structure and general rules of XML
		b. Validated XML document: when an XML document NOT ONLY follows proper structure and general rules of XML (well formed), but also verified against the rules set through either a DTD or Schema file about the tree structure that describes the data in XML file

	
	DTD file: Document Type Definition
	internal DTD: part of the same XML document
	external DTD file: *.dtd. link this file with the XML file

	Contains the defintion of
		- elements
		- attributes
		- entities
		- notations

	Cardinality of elemenmts: decide appearence rules
	* => 0 or many
	+ => at least 1 or many
	? => optional
	| => or

	PCDATA and 
	CDATA=> Unparsed CDATA the element contains some character data that should not be parsed by the parser
	#PCDATA => Parsed Character Data element contains data that is going to be parsed by the parser

	elements:
	attributes
	<!ATTLIST element-name attribute-name attribute_type default>
	possible attribute-types are:
	CDATA, Enumerated, ENTITY, ENTITIES, ID, IDREF, IDREFS, NMTOKEN, NOTATION

	attribute default, specified as: #IMPLIED, #REQUIRED, #FIXED or literal-value
	

	Schema file:


SGML: Standard Generalized Markup Language
XML files are processed by XML processor

XML can be used in distributed environemnt to represent data in platform and technology neutral manner
Note: JSON => JavaScript Object Notation
[
	{
		"name":"Kuldeep",
		"id":1,
		"salary":10000
		"isManager":false
	},
	{
	},
	{
	}
]

Difference with HTML:
	HTML creates/describes the structure of your web page
	XML describes data

	HTML uses pre-defined tags to describe the structure of the web page
	XML uses user-defined tags to describe the data

	

some sample employee data in CSV fromat:
---------------------------------------------------

name		id		salary
Kuldeep Soni,1,10000
Nikita,2,10000
sanjay,3,11000

character entities:
HTML character entity/XML character entity
it is used as replacement text when referencing its name between an ampersand and semicolon
