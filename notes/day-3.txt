JS:
	data types
	operators
	control flow statements

data types:
	string, number, boolean, object
	undefined, NaN, Infinity, NULL

	undefined => means a variable does not have any value assigned

Note: 
	a. there is no strict data typing. use var keyword to declare variables.
	b. there is no character data type. hence there is no difference between single and double quotes.
	c. since, there is no strict data typing in JS, hence any variable at different point of time can store values of different data type
	
	var x = 100
	x = 'Tanmay'
